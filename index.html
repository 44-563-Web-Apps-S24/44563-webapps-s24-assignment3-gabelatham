        <h3>El Nopal</h3>
        <p>It is my favorite restaurant because I really enjoy Mexican food and it is one of the few places that is 
            <b>not just fast food</b>. I also like the <b>variety</b> of food that they have compared to many of the 
            fast food places that serve mostly only burgers. The food <b>portions</b> are also just the right size 
            where you get completely full from 1 plate of food rather than being left wanting more.
