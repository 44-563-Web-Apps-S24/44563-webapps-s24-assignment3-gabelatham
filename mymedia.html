            I think that my favorite book is something called Cop Town. It is my favorite because it centers around 
            a spree of cop killings where there are 3 main characters, one of which is the villain and serial 
            killer. It's interesting because each chapters focuses on the life of one of the 3 characters and 
            shows the story from their point of view and alternates evenly between them. For example I remember 
            in one chapter it followed the female cop who was investigating one of the cop's deaths and then in 
            the next chapter it focused on the villain who had a monologue talking about why he did it and how, 
            all without every revealing his identity by only referring to him as "The Fox".

            I think that my favorite movie is probably Shawshank Redemption. It is my favorite because it shows
            an interesting story about a guy who is wrongly convicted and comes up with a clever way to live 
            comfortably. Which eventually allows him to escape after 20 years by using a tiny hammer used to 
            carve small stones into other things. He also makes friends with another character played by Morgan 
            Freeman who joins his escaped friend at the beach after he is released.
